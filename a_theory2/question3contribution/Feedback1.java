    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 9(can't give perfect 10)

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // Course was short but very informative, a good entry point into Spring - if I didn't have
    // 45 credits this semester, I'd surely switch my blog(that I wrote in Node.js for another
    // subject) to Spring.
    // Also I liked all the fantasy references during the lectures :)

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // course was very short - by which I mean it was only 3 creds! If it were 6 credit
    // course with extra Java stuff and some OOP sprinkled in, as well as some other web stuff
    // I'd give it a perfect 10!

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // I have this with all courses - if I had the opportunity to know everything in advance,
    // I'd do it in the first week, especially since I knew some Java and some Web
    // I think it will help students who aren't complete newbies to the topic
    // and that have a lot of work on their hands, to have the ability to write everything
    // in the first few days of the semester - given that they know the subject.
    // Other than that, for a 3 cred course it's very much okay
