    //todo A
    // In your words (do not copy wiki definitions)
    // What is gradle?
    // Answer: Gradle is a tool that bundles everything in the project, packages and
    // all code - makes sure it all works and everything is linked.
    // lets us run our code, as well as tests(which is also our code)

    //todo B
    // What is gradle wrapper? Why are we using it instead of gradle?
    // Answer: Gradle wrapper is a script that runs Gradle tasks with a specified version and settings.
    // It doesnâ€™t require the installation of the Gradle. When the Gradle with the wrapper is invoked,
    // it automatically downloads and builds the specified version.
    // The use of Gradle wrapper is to check if the user has installed the right version or not.
